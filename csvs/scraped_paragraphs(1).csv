https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Mayor Benjamin Magalong said he and a group of anticorruption mayors were fighting to secure their localities’ proper share of national taxes so local governments could finance more projects themselves.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Local governments have been able to access only a smaller percentage of their annual national tax share, Magalong said, because other officials, including lawmakers, control the disbursement of the rest of the funds."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,The summit presented “unsolicited” proposals which are being reviewed or are subjects of negotiations. De Leon said these proposals were pitched independently but were parts of an overall cure to Baguio’s “pain points.”
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Metro Pacific, which built and operates tollways like the North Luzon Expressway, is investing in the “Baguio Smart Urban Mobility Project,” which would regulate traffic flow using a unified dispatching system for jeepneys, minibuses and taxis and an online platform that directs motorists away from congested roads or guides them to the nearest parking facility."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Metro Pacific has tapped the system developed by Singaporean firm ST Engineering. It is also introducing a congestion fee to be collected from motorists should they drive through “pre-identified congestion areas” at certain times of the day.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"De Leon said urban mobility would benefit from a “Baguio City Intermodal Terminal,” which was discussed at the summit by Matthew Jaramillo, business development officer of Megawide Construction Corp., which put up the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange and won the bid for Phase 1 of the Metro Manila Subway project."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Jaramillo said the proposed central terminal would serve inbound and outbound buses.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"De Leon said the “Baguio City Sky Shuttle Project” of Metro Global Holdings Corp. also improves urban mobility. The company has offered to build an P11-billion electricity-driven train that would use an elevated monorail system that would improve air quality and reduce Baguio’s carbon footprint, according to Jaime Cacho, president of the affiliate firm, Metro Global Renewable Energy Corp."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"According to Cacho, his company is building a “circular economy” in the city because the train could be fueled by power generated by a waste-to-energy plant which Metro Global is developing with Baguio in the Benguet town of Sablan."
