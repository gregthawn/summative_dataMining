https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Today, Burnham’s contribution to the development of Baguio City is remembered through Baguio’s historic urban park which they named after Burnham."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Now that you know how Baguio started out as a city for recreation and relaxation, one question might be in your mind. How do you create a smart city from that?"

https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"MINERVA stands for Monitoring INdicators for Efficient Redevelopment and Value Assessment. Christopher Monterola, the project’s leader, had chosen Baguio to be an early adopter of the technology they wanted to innovate."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"At the beginning of the project, Engr. Felipe Puzon Jr., who serves as the Chief of Staff for the Mayor’s Office, had mentioned that the goal of the project was to boost the city’s urban renewal and use its existing technologies to create a smart Baguio city. Puzon also shared that Baguio was chosen because of its domestic and international appeal. And the fact that the city is developing into a highly-urbanized city poses the possibility of environmental problems and urban decay. Project MINERVA can be a way to protect the city."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Also according to Puzon, Baguio has four priority areas that need attention: water supply and quality, air pollution, urban mobility, and demand for tourism."

https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,The AI will address the four aforementioned issues under the project.
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"First, under air pollution control, the project will deploy AI models that can predict air quality in the city. This system will be able to detect unusual pollution levels which can help the city to craft programs and policies that can regulate the quality of air. Monterola, MINERVA’s project leader, stated that they will collaborate with Project ROAM’s sensor network to make this possible."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"On the matter of water supply and quality, Project MINERVA will be utilized to create a water quality sensor network.

The said concerns are air quality, river water quality, solid waste management, forest cover, traffic congestion, and the spread of informal settlers and illegal structures."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Monterola and his team want to make use of Baguio’s existing data and sensor systems to create a data hub that can be used as a decision-support platform when it comes to policymaking. With this artificial intelligence system, Baguio will be able to counter possible problems with suitable solutions. This is how a smart city is born. It’s an exciting thought to visit a smart Baguio in the future."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Project MINERVA is a promising venture into the digital world.

https://www.bworldonline.com/property/2024/04/30/591647/baguio-turns-to-data-science-ai-to-support-smart-city-objectives/,"The study warned that if not addressed within 25 years, the effects would be irreversible. Urban decay refers to the city regressing to a lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure, and resources."

https://www.bworldonline.com/property/2024/04/30/591647/baguio-turns-to-data-science-ai-to-support-smart-city-objectives/,"Meanwhile, Mr. Magalong acknowledged the system’s failure to detect the January diarrhea outbreak, attributing it to incorrectly installed sensors."
https://www.bworldonline.com/property/2024/04/30/591647/baguio-turns-to-data-science-ai-to-support-smart-city-objectives/,"“University of the Philippines (UP), together with the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), was able to develop an improved sensor.
