https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"At the beginning of the project, Engr. Felipe Puzon Jr., who serves as the Chief of Staff for the Mayor’s Office, had mentioned that the goal of the project was to boost the city’s urban renewal and use its existing technologies to create a smart Baguio city. Puzon also shared that Baguio was chosen because of its domestic and international appeal. And the fact that the city is developing into a highly-urbanized city poses the possibility of environmental problems and urban decay. Project MINERVA can be a way to protect the city."

https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"First, under air pollution control, the project will deploy AI models that can predict air quality in the city. This system will be able to detect unusual pollution levels which can help the city to craft programs and policies that can regulate the quality of air. Monterola, MINERVA’s project leader, stated that they will collaborate with Project ROAM’s sensor network to make this possible."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"On the matter of water supply and quality, Project MINERVA will be utilized to create a water quality sensor network.

The said concerns are air quality, river water quality, solid waste management, forest cover, traffic congestion, and the spread of informal settlers and illegal structures."
https://www.brittany.com.ph/blogs/project-minerva-development-smart-baguio/,"Monterola and his team want to make use of Baguio’s existing data and sensor systems to create a data hub that can be used as a decision-support platform when it comes to policymaking. With this artificial intelligence system, Baguio will be able to counter possible problems with suitable solutions. This is how a smart city is born. It’s an exciting thought to visit a smart Baguio in the future."

https://www.bworldonline.com/property/2024/04/30/591647/baguio-turns-to-data-science-ai-to-support-smart-city-objectives/,"“University of the Philippines (UP), together with the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), was able to develop an improved sensor.

The SC3 is being managed by the Information and Technology Division of the City Mayor's Office.

https://interaksyon.philstar.com/trends-spotlights/2023/07/29/256638/baguio-smart-city-command-center/,Here is a list of what the Smart City Command Center has achieved for Baguio City so far:
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"GRIDLOCK Congestion in Baguio City has become too big it can affect the summer capital’s economy with gridlocks becoming a normal occurrence. Infrastructure giants have offered solutions
in partnership proposals with the city government. —NEIL CLARK ONGCHANGCO"
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"BAGUIO CITY—The developers of Metro Manila’s subway, Singapore’s traffic management system, and Luzon’s expressways outlined their plans for redeveloping the heavily congested summer capital into a “smart city” and sparing it from urban decay at a two-day public-private partnership (PPP) summit this week."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Construction giants Metro Pacific, Megawide and Metro Global Holdings are among the country’s major investors negotiating with the city government about putting up an electric monorail serving downtown Baguio and neighboring Benguet towns, an AI (artificial intelligence)-powered mobility system to make traffic and mass transportation more efficient, a centralized transport terminal and a new public market."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"On the first summit session on Wednesday, former transportation undersecretary Mark de Leon, now vice president of Metro Pacific Investments Co., said road congestion and its impact on the economy and the environment were among Baguio’s key urban problems which the developers offered to solve."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Baguio was built by the American colonial government in the early 1900s and was designed for 25,000 people. But a 2019 urban carrying capacity study estimates that many of Baguio’s resources like water, woodlands and buildable spaces are no longer sufficient for its current population of 360,000."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"“Your road networks can’t accommodate the additional number of vehicles coming up during holidays,” De Leon said, partly due to what he described as “inefficient and unreliable public transportation.”"
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"“Sometimes tourists already think twice about going to Baguio because of that problem,” he added."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,But an urban poor organization asked why Baguio appeared to be relying on private sector capital.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"“We encourage the city to demand higher budgets (from the national government to finance) public utilities and services instead of PPPs,” said Daisy Bagni, secretary general of Ornus."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Mayor Benjamin Magalong said he and a group of anticorruption mayors were fighting to secure their localities’ proper share of national taxes so local governments could finance more projects themselves.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Local governments have been able to access only a smaller percentage of their annual national tax share, Magalong said, because other officials, including lawmakers, control the disbursement of the rest of the funds."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,The summit presented “unsolicited” proposals which are being reviewed or are subjects of negotiations. De Leon said these proposals were pitched independently but were parts of an overall cure to Baguio’s “pain points.”
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"Metro Pacific, which built and operates tollways like the North Luzon Expressway, is investing in the “Baguio Smart Urban Mobility Project,” which would regulate traffic flow using a unified dispatching system for jeepneys, minibuses and taxis and an online platform that directs motorists away from congested roads or guides them to the nearest parking facility."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Metro Pacific has tapped the system developed by Singaporean firm ST Engineering. It is also introducing a congestion fee to be collected from motorists should they drive through “pre-identified congestion areas” at certain times of the day.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"De Leon said urban mobility would benefit from a “Baguio City Intermodal Terminal,” which was discussed at the summit by Matthew Jaramillo, business development officer of Megawide Construction Corp., which put up the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange and won the bid for Phase 1 of the Metro Manila Subway project."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,Jaramillo said the proposed central terminal would serve inbound and outbound buses.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"De Leon said the “Baguio City Sky Shuttle Project” of Metro Global Holdings Corp. also improves urban mobility. The company has offered to build an P11-billion electricity-driven train that would use an elevated monorail system that would improve air quality and reduce Baguio’s carbon footprint, according to Jaime Cacho, president of the affiliate firm, Metro Global Renewable Energy Corp."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1841745/big-ticket-road-transport-systems-eyed-in-baguio,"According to Cacho, his company is building a “circular economy” in the city because the train could be fueled by power generated by a waste-to-energy plant which Metro Global is developing with Baguio in the Benguet town of Sablan."

https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Baguio City, Benguet – Not much has changed in the City of Pines since I last visited a year ago."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Except for the fact that Grab already operates here which makes it easier to move from one place to another, that Café by the Ruins in Shuntug (which caught fire and was closed in 2017) has reopened and that their branch in Upper Session Road moved to Gibraltar late last year, that SM Baguio has been renovated, Baguio remains basically the same."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,It is a sad reminder of what can become if sustainable is not made a priority by government.
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Attaining sustainability, however, is better said than done. Governments worldwide have found it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to address the negative environmental consequences of economic growth and globalization, and to find possible solutions to the problems caused by industrialization and population growth."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Filipinos are not new to this. Boracay Island gets as many as two million tourists and tens of billions of pesos in tourism receipts every year. It is home to thousands of hotels, resorts, and other business establishments, a far cry from the few that could be found 30 years ago, but at what cost? Boracay’s waters were teeming with waste, traffic was horrendous, pollution was at its peak. Government had to close the island for six months and had to order hundreds of business establishments closed for failure to connect their wastewater to the sewage system."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Now that the waters of Boracay are once again clean and business establishments are farther from the shoreline, the challenge to maintain this better state of things has presented itself. According to reports, Boracay residents are complaining about the spike in the number of Chinese businesses in the island, many of which have been closed due to violation of environmental laws. Chinese tourists, who are now the top visitors in Boracay, have also been the top violators of local ordinances, according to the Boracay Tourism Regulatory Enforcement Unit."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"But while it was possible to close Boracay completely for six months to tourists and businesses, the same is not possible for Baguio, the city being a gateway to other parts of the Cordillera, according to Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,The mayor said that the rehabilitation of the city would not be as drastic as that of Boracay and would instead be focused on massive regreening and improvement of the city’s sewerage system. Magalong revealed that the city’s rivers are polluted and that only 12 percent of Baguio’s houses are connected to the city’s sewerage treatment plant which has already exceeded its carrying capacity and has leaks.
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,Magalong revealed that Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu and Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Ano have agreed to bring to the attention of President Duterte the issuance of an order mandating the partial rehabilitation of Baguio and a one-year moratorium on the construction of buildings and cutting of trees in exchange for funds to rehabilitate the existing sewerage system.
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Balili River which flows to La Trinidad, Benguet has a reported fecal coliform bacteria level of 1.6 billion MPN per 100 milliliter, while that of Bued River that flows to Rosario, La Union has reached 465 million MPN, both beyond acceptable standards."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"As of presstime (Thursday), the heads of DENR, DILG and the tourism department are scheduled to visit the city to assess the situation in preparation for the city’s rehabilitation. According to the mayor, concerned offices will be presenting their priority projects."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"Plans of the city include putting up parking buildings using green architecture, rehabilitating the Baguio City Market in phases within two to three years at a cost of at least P5 billion, closing Mines View Park as part of an P18-million rehabilitation project, and closing Burnham Park and redeveloping it. Baguio City is also trying to secure a P20-billion soft loan and grant from the Asian Development Bank for the improvement of the city’s wastewater management and the provision of adequate potable water for the increasing population."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"The parking situation in Baguio has become so bad that once I had to secure a parking slot in the hotel, the car was parked there until it was time to go back to Manila. And this was during non-peak days. Imagine the parking and traffic nightmare during the Panagbenga festival, the Christmas holidays, Holy Week, and other long weekends. I dare not go to Baguio during those occasions. Not only is it difficult to hail a cab. Restaurants are full, everything is expensive, services are bad. Baguio residents dread these days because they can’t even leave the house and return unscathed, in a manner of speaking."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"As if the situation wasn’t bad enough, tourists are making it worse. According to Baguio City’s General Services Office, from the normal 170 tons of garbage collected in the city on normal days, this increased to over 200 tons daily from Dec. 21 up to the 30th. The littering problem also worsened especially in the central business district. Mayor Magalong lashed out at the lack of discipline and mindfulness in the disposal of trash, warning that he would recommend to the city council the passage of ordinances that would impose congestion and environmental fees on tourists."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"We haven’t even talked about the air pollution problem. Local newspapers have reported that around 750,000 private and public utility vehicles came in and out of Baguio City from Dec. 20, 2019 to Jan. 2, 2020. No wonder that the air quality here remains bad. As early as 2014, the World Health Organization had reported that Baguio had topped the list of Philippine cities with the most polluted air. Manila and Cebu came in second and third. Those living in Baguio have a higher risk of getting cancer, stroke, or heart disease, WHO said."
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,The unabated cutting of trees due to the construction of more and more buildings in the city is not helping.
https://www.philstar.com/business/2020/01/11/1983736/baguios-nightmare,"While restoring the good old days of Baguio City by putting up parking buildings and renovating tourist spots like Burnham Park, Mines View Park, and even the Baguio Public Market is good aesthetically and could be achieved in the short-term, implementing solutions to problems like air and water pollution, congestion, lack of urban planning that has resulted in buildings being constructed even in areas considered environmentally critical in order to attain sustainability should also be prioritized and done now."

https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,BAGUIO CITY – The Office of the Ombudsman was recently petitioned to investigate another graft charge filed against Mayor Benjamin B. Magalong in relation to the questionable implementation of the construction of the multi-million Irisan barangay hall that was funded under the annual budget of the public works department.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"In a 28-page affidavit complaint, Councilor Maria Mylen Victoria G. Yaranon also prayed that the Ombudsman preventively suspend the embattled mayor pursuant to existing laws, rules and regulations to stop him from influencing the investigation that will be conducted that will warrant the filing of the appropriate graft charges against him."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"At the onset, Mayor Magalong presented himself as a better implementor of projects and that he would ensure the quality and standard which he demands from other government agencies pursuant to his alleged crusade against graft and corruption."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"However, he should be made liable for the reported failure in the faithful implementation of the Irisan barangay hall project and the wise utilization of funds as he did nothing to prevent its alleged questionable implementation despite regular appraisal by the DPWH monitoring team of the project’s status."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Worst, Yaranon claimed that the city and its people were prejudiced for Magalong’s failed actions and that the city government has no other choice but to appropriate public funds for the project’s completion instead of wisely using these added funds for other badly needed projects and programs."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Likewise, Yaranon also charged Magalong and other officials deemed liable by the Ombudsman for grave misconduct, gross inexcusable negligence and acts prejudicial to the best interest of the service."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Earlier, the city government entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the Department of Public works and Highways–Cordillera Administrative Region (DPWH-CAR) on November 18, 2021 for the implementation of the project construction or improvement or rehabilitation of the Irisan multipurpose and barangay hall amounting to PhP50 million."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Under the MOA, the city shall undertake the procurement of the project through competitive bidding; ensure that all participating qualified bidders are registered in the DPWH civil works registry; implement the project pursuant with the approved program of works, plans and specifications, construction methodology, project cost and time duration approved by DPWH; comply with the DPWH materials testing requirements and quality control policies; evaluate and approve, in coordination with DPWH, all requests for variation orders, as-stake, revised plans among others and give full and complete access to DPWH inspectorate teams."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Further, the mayor allegedly agreed that the city government shall be fully accountable for all the funds released to it by the DPWH, that the agency shall release the funds to the city by way of cash advance in the initial amount of PhP25 million and the succeeding amounts or billings supposedly by way of actual accomplishments."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"On December 18, 2021, the project was awarded to KHATIB Construction with a contract duration of 350 calendar days to supposedly expire on December 8, 2022 and a contract amount of PhP42.7 million."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"On March 20, 2022, a meeting was held by the DPWH and the city representative where it was pointed out to the city that there was significant difference in the elevation of the footing and the size of columns compared to what was specified in the plans and that any changes made in relation to the project must be done in accordance with the MOA. During the said meeting, no variance order was submitted by the city and it was made known that the DPWH authority to use variance is limited to only 10 percent of the contract amount and beyond 10 percent needs clearance from the central office."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"On August 22, 2022, the DPWH again found out that steel reinforcements installed in the beams of the ground floor consists of mixed 25mm grade 40 and grade 60 while it is clear in the said instruction that 25mm grade 60 only be installed."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Moreover, it was stated in the communication addressed to the city that it is reminded that still, to date, no approved variation order, technical justification nor as-stake plan were submitted and received for concurrence of the DPWH, hence, the city’s supervision has no technical basis, and required specifications were not followed."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"On September 22, 2022, a status of project report by way of a memorandum was issued by the resident engineer, project inspector and project engineer of the DPWH which stated among others that the project as of date, the project was only 36 percent completed. It was noted that non-conformities to the original plan was previously reported have been continuously implemented without basis of revision and that there was still no approved variation order, technical justification nor as-stake plan, time suspension or extension submitted for the concurrence despite verbal and written requests."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Yaranon pointed out that despite the adverse findings and reports and demanded compliance with the MOA, particularly on the required variation orders, Magalong allegedly allowed KHATIB Construction to be paid as per fund utilization report dated April 4, 2023 of Acting City Accountant Freda Jimenez."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"According to the complaint, the contract status report by the DPWH covering June 2-14, 2023 showed that the physical status accomplishment as of December 31, 2022 was only 64 percent or a slippage of 36 percent and for March 31, 2023 was only 78 percent or 22 percent slippage. The slippage as of June 14, 2023 is 22 percent."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"On the financial status, Yaranon claimed that some PhP32.4 million was already transferred to the city."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"In a memorandum dated November 7, 2023, the DPWH recommended to the regional director the termination of the Irisan project along with other four projects covered by MOA with the city by reason of default. Aside from citing the inconsistencies in the billing of items, continuance of the project without variation orders and physical accomplishment of only 78 percent, it also cited reasons based on existing rules and regulations."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Yaranon argued that the mayor, by entering into such agreement to undertake the Irisan project which is normally implemented by the line agencies like the DPWH, has put himself as a trustee of the project and of the funds, thus, a fiduciary relation was created and he has to exercise extraordinary diligence in the implementation of the said project so that public funds will be spent pursuant to law and the MOA and that the desired project should be done pursuant to the project plans and specifications."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"She underscored that in the prosecution of the project, the mayor grossly violated the terms of the MOA and has caused undue injury to the government, the DPWH, the city, barangay Irisan and the public who are supposed to benefit pursuant to the timeline of its construction."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"The complainant emphasized that Magalong allegedly gave KHATIB Construction unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence. He also allegedly deliberately failed to exercise due diligence and efficiency in the prosecution of the project pursuant to the MOA when made aware and appraised of its status, particularly unauthorized variations in the plans, quantity and quality of materials and funding. It resulted to the ultimate failure to deliver completion of the project on time and worst, the reversion to DPWH of the much needed funds."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,The mayor allegedly failed to exercise accordingly the slightest caution and care or act on the reported discrepancies which he ought to know or have known being the implementor and signatory to the contract. It was made known to his subordinates and to him personally.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,She accused the mayor of having signed the voucher for payment which is tantamount to alleged grave misconduct and malversation by paying the contractor beyond the amount transferred to the city without authority or needed appropriation ordinance from the city council at least in the amount of PhP11.050 million. The mayor allegedly disbursed the said money illegally and obviously to favor the contractor to the damage and prejudice of the city.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"In the 6th billing attached to the complaint, said materials were already fully installed but as per observation of the DPWH in a report dated November 7, 2023, there were still inconsistencies in the progress billings, particularly on the reinforcing steel bars grade 60 which was an original quantity."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Yaranon questioned the reduction of the 25mm grade 60 from its original quantity of 158,138.00 kilos to only 60,197.79 kilos when in fact the said original quantity was installed 87 percent as per second billing."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/baguio-mayor-faces-another-malversation-charge/,"Yaranon alleged that the grave misconduct, gross inexcusable negligence, utter lack of care by the mayor in the faithful implementation of the project as per MOA and management of for the completion of the project resulted to the waste of the DPWH funds which could have been used to complete the project as only PhP32.4 million was downloaded from the budget of PhP50 million or only 64.96 percent utilization only.

https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,BAGUIO CITY – The fourth graft charge against Mayor Benjamin B. Magalong and two other ranking city officials relative to the construction of the Wright Park multipurpose buildings were recently filed before the Office of the Ombudsman following the earlier cases that are now being investigated.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"In an 18 page affidavit complaint, Councilor Maria Mylen Victoria G. Yaranon and Ryan Dale Mangusan prayed for the immediate implementation of the preventive suspension against mayor Magalong, city Administrator Bonifacio dela Pena and City Building Official Arch. Johnny Degay pending the investigation to prevent them from tinkering with the documents that are in their possession which are material evidence and if not secured would compromise its integrity and the case."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"Likewise, the complainants claimed that potential witnesses such as employees in the local government in custody of material documents might be subjected to harassment once the complained officials will not be outrightly suspended."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"Further, they added that the preventive suspension against the said officials will give free hand in the investigation of the case."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"The complaint alleged that Magalong, dela Pena and Degay, while in the performance of their official functions, as the incumbent mayor and head of procuring entity, chairman of the bids and Awards Committee (BAC), member of BAC and head of the implementing department of the projects of the local government, respectively, conspired or collaborated to award to Khatib Construction the two infrastructure projects construction of multipurpose buildings at Wright Park with project cost of PhP49.5 million despite the fact that the company was already disqualified for tendering a bid with an incomplete detailed cost estimate and the company is disqualified because of an ongoing project with the city which is not yet completed even after twice extension."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,The complaint added that the violation of the memorandum of agreement between the local government and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for the former to undertake the project through competitive bidding led to the failure of the contractor to implement the project and ultimately its cancellation and return of funds to the DPWH to the prejudice of both the local government and the DPWH.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"“This amount became a loss to the city due to acts of the respondents in giving their chosen contractor unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of their official administrative functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, gross inexcusable negligence or gross incompetence” they added."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"In order to complete the project, Magalong reportedly requested the city council to appropriate the amount of PhP30 million and PhP50 million for the two projects which would not have been necessary if they had been more circumspect in the discharge of their functions, particularly in the procurement process. It would have been different if the project was awarded to a contractor which had the competence."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"According to the complaint, the act constitutes the administrative offenses of grave misconduct, gross inexcusable negligence, gross incompetence and acts prejudicial to the best interest of the service."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"As of December 21, 2023, the DPWH – Baguio City District Engineering office reported that the Wright Park project was slow pacing and can no longer be completed on December 31, 2023 as mandated under the agreement due to lack of material time, thus, it recommended for the termination of the agreements. Funds that were not yet transferred to the local government will already be reverted to the national coffers considering that the validity of the appropriation ended last December 31, 2023."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"For the other Wright Park project, it was already terminated by default by the local government on September 25, 2023 due to contractor’s fault while the project was ongoing, it has incurred a slippage of 15 percent or more, does not actually have on the project site the technical personnel listed on the bid  as required for the project, does not execute the contracts in accordance with the contract or persistently or flagrantly neglected to carry out obligations under the contract and poor workmanship."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"The complainants asserted that as a consequence of the failures of respondents to comply with the obligation of the city in the agreements for implementation of the said projects funded by the DPWH, Magalong proposed the realignment of some funds for the completion of the projects to the prejudice of other approved and funded projects that have to be sacrificed."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"Moreover, it stipulated that the respondents were aware of the uncompleted project of Khatib Construction, the questionable Irisan project and they know of the violations such as use of unprescribed materials, delays committed by the contractor and pending documentary requirements for variation orders besting the project apart from the fact that the DPWH stopped the downloading of funds because of repeated violations, most of all, they know of the slippage of more than negative 15 percent or negative 22 percent slippage."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,"Earlier, Magalong in separate media interviews claimed that the string of cases filed against him before the Ombudsman are products of false accusations aside from being politically motivated but he never dwelt in answering the allegations of the complaint."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/4th-graft-case-filed-versus-3-baguio-officials/,The complainants emphasized that their complaint is being made in good faith and not for any political purpose but to uphold the essence of accountability and good governance in the public service and sanctity of the government policy that public office is a public trust.

The city’s garbage would have fueled a waste-to-energy plant being developed in Benguet but the local government says it will scrap the projects due to the technology’s environmental impact. —NEIL CLARK ONGCHANGCO"
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"BAGUIO CITY, Benguet, Philippines — The local government will no longer push through with its waste-to-energy projects, Mayor Benjamin Magalong said at a Wednesday zero-waste forum that denounced the technology’s potential harm to the environment."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Baguio waste managers would instead focus on reducing the city’s daily trash, Magalong told students and environmental activists who listened to zero-waste expert Jorge Emmanuel’s lecture on dioxins and furans."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"These are extremely toxic byproducts of incinerators and the most advanced thermal power plants in Europe, said Emmanuel, a chemical engineer who is a global consultant on waste management and who serves as an adjunct environmental science professor for graduate studies at Silliman University."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Magalong said he entertained waste-to-energy technology as a primary solution to Baguio’s garbage problem, “but after listening to you (Emmanuel), I would like to officially declare that the city of Baguio will be abandoning its waste-to-energy [options],” drawing cheers from students at the University of the Cordilleras, which hosted the forum."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"The city has been spending over P200 million annually to ship its trash to commercial landfills, but it could spend much more should the government close the ecological sanitary landfill in Capas, Tarlac, by the end of the year."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Each day, about 550 metric tons of trash are produced by a population of under 400,000, coupled with waste left by tourists."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Toward the end of 2023, Magalong signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Metro Global Holdings Corp., a company owned by businessman Robert John Sobrepeña, which is developing a 15-megawatt waste-to-energy plant in neighboring Sablan town in Benguet province."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,The agreement commits most of Baguio’s garbage to the power plant once it is built under a feedstock contract that may now need to be withdrawn after Magalong’s pronouncement.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"The facility would also absorb trash produced by the Benguet towns of La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba and Tublay. Together with Baguio and Sablan, these communities make up the BLISTT metropolis. Magalong did not explain how he could unilaterally break the existing MOA with his declaration at Wednesday’s forum."

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"In an interview on Thursday, Councilor Betty Lourdes Tabanda, chair of the health and environment committee, said the city council would review the deal."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"When he first assumed office in 2019, Magalong negotiated a waste-to-energy project pitched by Japanese engineering firm Toyo Energy Solution Co. Ltd., but talks failed to resolve the high tariff that would need to be shouldered by residents."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"In the same year, zero-waste proponent Paul Connett, author of the book “Zero Waste Solution,” described waste-to-energy as a “lazy” political solution during a talk he gave at City Hall."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"According to Connett, the business model for generating power using waste shows that the value of the electricity produced does not make up for the expenses for the medical treatment of people, as well as the inevitable cleanup of the surrounding environment."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"On Wednesday, Emmanuel said the radius of the dioxin impact of a Sablan waste-to-energy plant could be 10 kilometers and may reach other Benguet towns and La Union province."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,Tabanda said on Thursday she had reservations about Metro Global’s waste-to-energy project because it would disrupt Baguio’s original goal of minimizing garbage set by a now outdated solid waste master plan.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Instead, households and businesses would generate more waste to fuel the power plant, she said on the sidelines of a public consultation on amendments to the city’s 2017 ordinance banning plastics. Removing plastics, which make up 80 percent of Baguio’s residual waste, would contribute to the reduction of trash sent to landfills.Among the proposed changes is a city-wide ban on the sale or use of single-use plastics like “sando bags,” straws and fast food utensils, which is enforced by an executive order issued by Magalong."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,Tabanda said the amendments might include a pollution fee of P5 per item in cases where businesses have no locally manufactured and cost-effective alternatives in the market.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1968551/waste-to-energy-projects-in-baguio-to-be-scrapped,"Eugene Buyuccan, the city government’s general services officer, said Magalong instructed him to fast-track a city-wide materials recovery program, beginning with four pilot barangays."

https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,"Mayor Alfredo Dacumos, Jr. said that the proposed multi-billion waste to energy project supposed to be undertaken by the Metro Global Renewables Corporation in partnership with the Baguio City government has not been accepted by the municipal government and the indigenous peoples (IPs) in the municipality contrary to earlier pronouncements that the company already applied for the issuance of the environmental compliance certificate (ECC) of the project."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,He pointed out that one of the requirements for the issuance of an ECC for the proposed waste to energy project is social acceptability of the host IPs and local government which was never been issued; that is why it would be impossible for the company to be granted the said important document to pursue the project.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,"Further, he claimed that the proposed site of the waste to energy project is allegedly near the national highway and near some residences which would not be feasible in the first place that is why the municipal government had been recommending that the site for the environmentally-critical project should be located away from major roads and communities because of its projected negative impact to the environment and the health of the people."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,The municipal chief executive disclosed that municipal officials heaved a sigh of relief after it was formally announced by Baguio City officials that the proposed waste to energy project in the municipality will no longer be pursued for various reasons.
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,"“We are elated over the recent developments that resulted in the non-continuance of the proposed waste to energy project in our locality because it would eventually erase the perception of the people that we compromised their interest in exchange for the project. From the start, we never agreed or allowed the project to be implemented in our municipality until the proponent shall have complied with the requirements that include the free and prior informed consent of the indigenous peoples, among others, which they never sought,” Mayor Dacumos stressed."
https://baguioheraldexpressonline.com/sablan-elated-over-withdrawal-of-wte-project/,"The mayor pointed out that from the consultations conducted among the residents, people do not want Sablan to become the dumping ground of waste from outside the municipality because of potential threats to the state of the environment and the health of the people, aside from other negative impacts to the communities near the proposed facility."

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,A recent furlough to Baguio City recently has brought me and my companions more stress rather than relaxation due to unbearable traffic congestion and overcrowding of places to visit. The cool breeze of the city likewise seemed to be affected by these.
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"The city of pines has been one of my favorite destinations since my younger years. Foremost, one can typically enjoy the place’ cold weather and the beautiful sceneries that are relaxing. Before, there were lots of pine trees even in the city proper. Their scent complements the natural smell of the air."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"There are many places to visit in Baguio mostly inspired by nature such as the mountains, trees, flowers and others. There are a thousand shops which up to now, market local products mostly can found only in the Cordilleras. These shops sell souvenir items, clothing, food and delicacies and many others."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"In Camp John Hay, one can relax at the place, the scenery and the cold air enveloping the former US military camp. The Philippine Military Academy is another place of interest because of its facilities and war memorabilia. The PMA is the country’s top producer of military generals."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"The Baguio Public Market is a must-visit place for pasalubongs since they offer the best price of many things as compared to shops and roadside stalls. The market is also the product hub within the city, thus offering the cheaper prices of goods."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"Over the years, Baguio City keeps on attracting local and foreign tourists. This fact makes the city a magnet for vehicles which would add up to the already bloated local vehicle population of Baguio City. The number of vehicles plying the roads and streets of the city keeps on growing but the number of the latter is still the same, thus resulting in traffic congestion."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"Even prior to the holiday season, the city's congestion of people as well as vehicles is already a serious concern. During the holidays, vehicular traffic remains at a standstill. The city was at par with Metro Manila’s EDSA which was dubbed before as the biggest parking place in the world."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"When Baguio City was developed in the early 1900’s, urban planning was never a subject yet among developers. What was once a vacation place with the number of visitors peaking only during summer, Baguio City’s population (residents and transients), swells all year round now."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"Recently, the city government of Baguio has announced that it shall be resorting to Artificial Intelligence (AI) for its traffic and parking management. This perhaps is the solution to the growing problem of over congestion and traffic gridlocks."
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/congested-baguio-city,"Through AI, traffic managers can easily come up with solutions to traffic problems with the aid of modern technology. The AI can now manage where to put vehicles and even humans as well to avoid congestions. While we cannot extend the land area of the city, we might perhaps regulate vehicles instead."

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Baguio, Eastern Samar, and Surigao del Norte receive the highest rainfall in the country, with the summer capital itself taking in as much as 4,064 millimeters (160 inches) of rain annually, according to data supplied by Program Boondock, a collaboration of Cordillera universities undertaking climate-related projects financed by the Department of Science and Technology."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"The Mt. Santo Tomas Rain Basin, which was constructed by American engineers in the early years of the 20th century, is Baguio’s largest rain collection facility with a 700,000 cubic-meter capacity. But the reservoir water had been preserved this year to be used during El Niño."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Royeca recommended collecting water tax in the form of additional environmental fees from the city’s seasonal guests; or a “polluters’ tax,” to be paid by high-impact businesses that consume huge amounts of water."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,He said this would help raise capital for the construction of more rainwater-harvesting facilities.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"The fees to cover water consumption by tourists and nonresidents are meant to be their contribution to sustaining Baguio’s water resources, Royeca stressed."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"According to him, the preservation of Baguio’s remaining watersheds in its forested areas is also crucial. Government foresters have estimated that Baguio still has 2.5 million trees, mostly in the city’s remaining protected forests."

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Parts of Baguio rely on rationed water on certain days of the week because highly populated neighborhoods like Quirino Hill and Quezon Hill do not have their own underground water sources, unlike other sections of the city, Royeca explained."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"BWD hydrologists have failed to discover and develop safe water sources in these areas, so water pumped from other districts is diverted to these communities, he said."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"This year, the BWD has managed to sustain the city’s daily water demand of about 45,066.03 cubic meters by generating 44,607.43 cu. m. Its latest projections indicated an improvement in supply by 2029 (53,090.38 cu. m. of water for a demand of 52,891.32 cu. m.) and 2031 (57,953.87 cu. m. for a demand of 55,452.41 cu. m.)."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"But the annual influx of tourists between December and May generates “artificial demand” of roughly 20 percent more than the available supply, Royeca said.Recharging"
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Baguio has a population of 366,358 (as of the 2020 census), but an urban carrying capacity report commissioned by the National Economic and Development Authority in 2019 said the city’s “daytime” population could rise to as high as 700,000 due to tourists, out-of-town vendors or entrepreneurs, and students residing in neighboring towns in Benguet and the Ilocos region."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Certeza Infosys, which conducted the carrying capacity report, said “the population threshold” of Baguio’s water supply is 267,546 consumers, indicating it has already been breached.Program Boondock has been testing an artificial rainwater recharging system at Baguio’s Burnham Park and in the strawberry fields of La Trinidad town in Benguet."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"But the BWD has used the same reengineering principle in some of Baguio’s watersheds by constructing ditches to direct rainwater directly to natural aquifer recharge areas in the forests, Royeca said."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"A small company recently offered to harness the water collected at Burnham Park, including its man-made lake, said Councilor Mylene Yaranon."
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,Councilor Leandro Yangot has also filed a resolution that encourages big-water consumers like golf courses to build massive rainwater reservoirs for the public.
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794048/baguio-govt-urged-to-tax-tourists-for-water-use,"Major companies have offered to put up bulk water projects for Baguio but the cost may be prohibitive, Royeca noted."
